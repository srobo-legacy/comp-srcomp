    Our own random number generator that is guaranteed to be stable.

    Python's random number generator's stability across Python versions is
    complicated. Different versions will produce different results. It's easier
    right now to just have our own random number generator that's not as good,
    but is definitely stable between machines.

    .. note::
       This class is deliberately not a sub-class of :py:class:`random.Random`
       since any of the functionality provided by the class (i.e. not just the
       generation portion) could change between Python versions. Instead, any
       additionally required functionality should be added below as needed
       and _importantly_ tests for the functionality to ensure that the output
       is the same on all supported platforms.
